// While not deprecations, we have also skipped the following warnings:
// ds.store.findRecord.id-mismatch,
// ds.store.push-link-for-sync-relationship
// in a registerWarnHelper method in app.js
// These warnings are related to the json api viloation that is using slugs rather than ids
// to send information back and forth between api and client. Removing these warnings would
// require a large refactor to use ids rather than slugs in both the api and client and so
// we are just hiding them for now.
