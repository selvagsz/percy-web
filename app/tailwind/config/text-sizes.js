|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here is where you define your text sizes. Name these in whatever way
| makes the most sense to you. We use size names by default, but
| you're welcome to use a numeric scale or even something else
| entirely.
|
| By default Tailwind uses the "rem" unit type for most measurements.
| This allows you to set a root font size which all other sizes are
| then based on. That said, you are free to use whatever units you
| prefer, be it rems, ems, pixels or other.
|
| Class name: .text-{size}
